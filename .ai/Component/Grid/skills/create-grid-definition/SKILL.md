# create-grid-definition

Read `@.ai/Component/Grid/CONTEXT.md` for the factory trilogy (GridDefinitionFactory → GridDataFactory → GridFactory) and SearchCriteria patterns.

## 1. Grid Definition Factory

Create `src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/{Domain}GridDefinitionFactory.php` extending `AbstractGridDefinitionFactory`:

- Define a `public const GRID_ID = '{domain}'` constant — this is the single source of truth for the grid identifier, shared with the `{Domain}Filters` class to ensure the filter persistence in DB maps to the correct grid
- `getId(): string` — return `self::GRID_ID`
- `getName(): string` — translatable grid name
- `getColumns(): ColumnCollection` — all columns (see section 2)
- `getFilters(): FilterCollection` — filterable columns (see section 4)
- `getGridActions(): GridActionCollection` — grid-level actions (e.g. export)
- `getRowActions(): RowActionCollection` — per-row actions (see section 3)
- `getBulkActions(): BulkActionCollection` — multi-select actions (see section 3)

**Reference:** `src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/TaxGridDefinitionFactory.php` (simple), `src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/ManufacturerGridDefinitionFactory.php` (two grids)

## 2. Column types

| Column type | When to use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BulkActionColumn` | Row selection checkbox | Always first column |
| `DataColumn` | Plain text (name, email, date) | Most common |
| `ToggleColumn` | Clickable boolean toggle (active status) | Requires AJAX toggle route |
| `ImageColumn` | Image thumbnail (logo) | |
| `LinkColumn` | Text with hyperlink | |
| `PositionColumn` | Drag handle for reordering | See `create-position-column` skill |
| `ActionColumn` | Row actions dropdown | Always last column |

Column IDs must be `snake_case` and exactly match the SQL column aliases in the query builder.

## 3. Row actions and bulk actions

### Row actions

Add in `getRowActions()`:
- `LinkRowAction` for edit — links to `admin_{domain}s_edit` route with `{id}` parameter
- `LinkRowAction` for delete — links to `admin_{domain}s_delete` with `confirm_message` option for JS confirmation
- Order: edit first, delete last

### Bulk actions

Add in `getBulkActions()`:
- `SubmitBulkAction` for each bulk operation (delete, enable, disable, or any other)
- Each submits the grid form to the corresponding controller route
- Bulk delete must include a confirmation dialog (`confirm_bulk_action: true`)
- Only add bulk actions that the entity actually supports — not all entities have enable/disable

Route names in actions must exactly match the routing YAML.

## 4. Filters

Filters are defined in the grid definition via `getFilters(): FilterCollection`. Each filter specifies:
- Filter ID (must match a column ID)
- The form type to render (e.g. `TextType`, `ChoiceType`, `DateRangeType`)
- All filter fields are optional (`required: false`)

These filter definitions are used by the grid rendering to build the filter bar. They are NOT a separate form type class.

## 5. {Domain}Filters class (SearchCriteria)

Create `src/Core/Search/Filters/{Domain}Filters.php` extending `Filters`:

- This implements `SearchCriteriaInterface` — it is NOT a form type
- Uses the `GRID_ID` constant from the definition factory to ensure the filter ID matches the grid — this is critical for filter persistence in DB
- Defines defaults: grid ID, default sort column, sort direction, limit
- Injected into the controller's `indexAction` via argument resolver
- Filter values are populated from the session (saved by `CommonController::searchGridAction`)

```php
class {Domain}Filters extends Filters
{
    protected $filterId = {Domain}GridDefinitionFactory::GRID_ID;

    public static function getDefaults(): array
    {
        return [
            'limit' => static::LIST_LIMIT,
            'offset' => 0,
            'orderBy' => 'id_{domain}',
            'sortOrder' => 'asc',
            'filters' => [],
        ];
    }
}
```

**Reference:** `src/Core/Search/Filters/TaxFilters.php` (simple)

## 6. Service registration

Register in DI YAML:

- `{Domain}GridDefinitionFactory` — with parent `prestashop.core.grid.definition.factory.abstract_grid_definition` and grid ID
- `{Domain}Filters` — with `autoconfigure: true`
- Wire the GridFactory service combining definition factory + data factory
- Verify: `php bin/console debug:container | grep {domain}`

## Rules

- Column IDs must match query builder SELECT aliases exactly
- ToggleColumn requires a dedicated AJAX toggle route
- BulkActionColumn always first, ActionColumn always last
- Route names in actions must match routing YAML exactly — typos cause silent 404s
- `{Domain}Filters` is SearchCriteria, not a form type
